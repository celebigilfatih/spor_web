# Technical Staff Page - Dynamic Implementation

## Summary

The technical staff page at `http://localhost:8090/technical-staff` has been successfully converted from static HTML to a fully dynamic database-driven page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Model Methods (`/app/models/TechnicalStaffModel.php`)

**Problem:** The model was using the column name `role` but the database table uses `position`.

**Fixed Methods:**
- `getHeadCoach()` - Now uses `position LIKE '%Baş Antrenör%'`
- `getAssistantCoaches()` - Filters coaches (excluding head coach, goalkeeper, and fitness coaches)
- `getGoalkeepingCoaches()` - Uses `position LIKE '%Kaleci%'`
- `getFitnessCoaches()` - Uses `position LIKE '%Kondisyon%'`
- `getMedicalStaff()` - Uses `position LIKE '%Doktor%' OR '%Fizyoterapist%' OR '%Masör%'`
- `getOtherStaff()` - Returns all other staff members

### 2. Redesigned View (`/app/views/frontend/staff/index.php`)

**New Features:**
- ✅ Dynamic data fetching from database
- ✅ Helper functions for date calculations
- ✅ Automatic image fallback to placeholder
- ✅ Responsive staff cards
- ✅ Organized by categories (Coaches, Goalkeepers, Fitness, Medical, Other)
- ✅ Empty state handling when no staff found
- ✅ Professional card-based layout

**Helper Functions Added:**
```php
calculateAge($birthDate)           // Calculates age from birth date
calculateYearsAtClub($joinedDate)  // Calculates tenure at club
getStaffImage($photo, $position)   // Returns staff photo or placeholder
```

### 3. Created Professional CSS (`/public/css/technical-staff.css`)

**Design Features:**
- Modern gradient header
- Animated staff cards with hover effects
- Responsive grid layout
- Professional color scheme matching site theme
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Mobile-optimized design

**Key Components:**
- Head coach profile section with large photo
- Staff cards with photo, name, position, experience, and license
- Category headers with icons
- Philosophy section with principle cards
- Empty state styling

### 4. Created Default Staff Image (`/public/images/default-staff.svg`)

A professional SVG placeholder image for staff members without photos.

## Database Structure

The page now dynamically fetches data from the `technical_staff` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE technical_staff (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    position VARCHAR(100),           -- Used for role (Baş Antrenör, Antrenör, etc.)
    team_id INT,
    photo VARCHAR(255),
    bio TEXT,
    experience_years INT,
    license_type VARCHAR(100),
    nationality VARCHAR(50),
    birth_date DATE,
    joined_date DATE,
    contract_end DATE,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    status ENUM('active','inactive'),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Current Sample Data

The database currently contains 5 staff members:

1. **Mehmet Özkan** - Baş Antrenör (15 years, UEFA A Lisansı)
2. **Ali Demir** - Antrenör (8 years, UEFA B Lisansı)
3. **Fatih Kaya** - Kaleci Antrenörü (12 years, Kaleci Antrenörü Lisansı)
4. **Dr. Ahmet Yıldız** - Doktor (20 years, Tıp Doktoru)
5. **Hasan Çelik** - Kondisyoner (10 years, Kondisyon Antrenörü Sertifikası)

## How It Works

### Controller Flow
```
TechnicalStaff Controller

    - Head Coach
    - Assistant Coaches
    - Goalkeeping Coaches
    - Fitness Coaches
    - Medical Staff
    - Other Staff
    ↓
Passes to View
    ↓
View renders dynamic HTML with data
```

### Page Sections

1. **Page Header** - Title and breadcrumb navigation
2. **Head Coach Section** - Featured profile with large photo and bio
3. **Coaching Staff** - Categorized sections:
   - Antrenörler (Coaches)
   - Kaleci Antrenörleri (Goalkeeping Coaches)
   - Kondisyon Antrenörleri (Fitness Coaches)
   - Sağlık Ekibi (Medical Staff)
   - Diğer Personel (Other Staff)
4. **Philosophy Section** - Training philosophy and principles

## Features

### Empty State Handling

- `/admin/technical-staff`

The admin panel allows:
- Adding new staff members
- Editing existing staff
- Uploading photos
- Setting positions and experience
- Managing active/inactive status

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Staff Detail Pages**
   - Individual profile pages for each staff member

   - Photo galleries

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Staff statistics dashboard
   - Social media links
   - Contact information

3. **Advanced Organization**
   - Team-based filtering (A Team, Youth Teams, etc.)
   - Role-based sorting
   - Experience-based categorization

## Testing

Visit the page at:
**http://localhost:8090/technical-staff**

The page will:
1. Load staff from database
2. Display head coach prominently
3. Show categorized staff in grid layout
4. Show empty states for categories with no staff
5. Display placeholder images for staff without photos

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `/app/models/TechnicalStaffModel.php` - Fixed column names from `role` to `position`
- `/app/views/frontend/staff/index.php` - Complete redesign with dynamic data

### Created:
- `/public/css/technical-staff.css` - Professional styling (327 lines)
- `/public/images/default-staff.svg` - Default staff placeholder image

## Technical Notes

- All SQL queries use `position` column (not `role`)
- Searches use `LIKE` for flexible matching (e.g., "Baş Antrenör", "Antrenör Yardımcısı")
- Helper functions are defined in the view for data formatting
- UTF-8 Turkish collation support for Turkish characters
- Image paths checked before display with file_exists()
- All data sanitized with htmlspecialchars()
